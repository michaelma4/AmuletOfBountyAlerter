# Amulet Of Bounty Alerter
This plugin will alert you when you're not wearing your [Amulet of Bounty](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Amulet_of_bounty).

The Amulet of Bounty begins with 10 charges. When equipped, there is a 25% chance to use one seed instead of three when 
planting them in allotment patches, consuming 1 charge. This is most useful when planting snape grass seeds as they 
are the most costly allotment seed.

Configuration features include:

-A toggle to show the overlay warning globally or only while near allotment patches
